## Introduction

Cafe Story is an exhilarating and interactive game developed by our dedicated team, inspired by the fast-paced and fun dynamics of popular cooking games like Overcooked. In Cafe Story, players dive into the bustling world of a cafe, striving to fulfill a variety of food and drink orders within a limited timeframe. The gameplay is designed to test players' time management and multitasking skills, offering an engaging and challenging experience.

- Filling cups with coffee and serving them to customers.
- Efficiently managing time to maximize order fulfillment before the clock runs out.

## Development Tools and Assets

Our team utilized Unity, a powerful and versatile game development platform, to bring Cafe Story to life. We leveraged a selection of free assets from the Unity Asset Store to enhance the visual and functional aspects of the game. These assets played a pivotal role in creating an immersive and visually appealing environment for the players.
